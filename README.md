# Bread Math
A C++ header only template library which is not particularly good, but it's mine. The library is mostly in the style of hlsl math operations but it's a bit of a mess at the moment as I didn't know what convetions I was going for when I made it. A lot of functions are still unimplemented and a lot of code needs to be refactored or optimized.
